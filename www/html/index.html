    CHANGELOG<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>[FEAT] Basic css with skeleton.css (I hate you all)</li>
        <li>[BUG] Fixed incorrect table HTML bolding all the fields and wasting the markdown</li>
        <li>[FEAT] [BUG] Added mardown support and sanitization sitewide</li>
        <li>[FEAT] Added a simple forum</li>
        <li>[BUG] Several bug fixes with regard to image uploads and others</li>
        <li>[FEAT] Changed sexual orientation to preference, so as to better enable looking for friendship as well as deeper relationships. Users must update their profiles manually.</li>
        <li>[FEAT] [BUG] Changed buggy location filter to distance filter (will show anyone within a 2 degrees (~220km) radius)</li>
        <li>[FEAT] Added map support through OpenStreetMap. If your location isn't identified with a "1" marker after a location update, try to spell it differently.</li>
        <li>[PERF] Images in browser and matches list now limited to 480 width (height is resized following aspect ratio). Full images are still displayed in user's profile.</li>
        <li>[BUG] Fixed broken image display when profile has no pictures uploaded</li>
        <li>[BUG] Fixed images larger than 65535 bytes not uploading fully</li>
    </ul>
